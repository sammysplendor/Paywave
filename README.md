**Paywave**

Paywave is a frontend-focused fintech web application built to demonstrate clean UI design, structured user flows, and solid front-end engineering practices using vanilla web technologies.

The project simulates a digital payment platform experience, focusing on how real-world fintech products handle layout, interaction, and user feedback—without backend complexity.

**Project Overview:**

Paywave was designed as a **frontend-only project** to showcase how a modern fintech interface can be structured, styled, and made interactive using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

All data used in the application is mock data created for demonstration purposes. There is no backend, database, or API integration. This allows full focus on UI behavior, state handling on the client side, and clean, maintainable code organization.


**Features:**

- Responsive and modern fintech-style UI
- Authentication flow simulation using mock data
- Form validation and user feedback states
- Interactive dashboard components
- Light/Dark mode theming
- Clean layout structure inspired by real payment platforms


**Tech Stack:**

No frameworks. No backend. No APIs. Pure frontend.


**Data & State Handling:**

- All user and transaction data are locally mocked
- JavaScript is used to simulate user state and interactions
- The structure is intentionally designed to be easily extendable if a backend is added in the future


**Purpose of This Project:**

This project was built as part of a frontend portfolio to:
- Demonstrate real-world UI thinking for fintech products
- Show clean separation of concerns in frontend code
- Practice scalable layout and interaction patterns
- Highlight attention to usability, accessibility, and detail


**Notes:**

- This is not a production-ready payment system
- No real transactions are processed
- No sensitive or real user data is involved
